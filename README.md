# DeBunning Service - The Ultimate Solution for Bun Removal

## Overview
Welcome to the **DeBunning Service**, the most sophisticated and technologically advanced solution for removing buns from humans. Whether you're dealing with a **HoneyBun**, a **CinnamonBun**, or an unsuspecting **ManBun**, our software is designed to de-bun with precision, ensuring no bun is left behind.

This service uses cutting-edge technology (i.e., rusty scissors) to detect, analyze, and remove buns with minimal side effects, including but not limited to: **angry Daniel**, **awkward silence**, and **general confusion**.

## How It Works
At the heart of our operation is **Daniel**, the man at risk of losing his bun. Our system leverages highly sophisticated algorithms (and a bit of luck) to locate Daniel, check his bun status, and determine whether he’s in a peaceful mood or if he’s about to unleash his full wrath on us. The de-bunning process works in three simple steps:

1. **Locate Daniel**: Use the **HumanFinderAPI** to track down our bun-bearing subject.
2. **Check for Bun**: If Daniel has a bun, we proceed with the operation.
3. **De-Bun**: Using our patented **RustyScissors**, we gently snip the bun away. (But beware, if Daniel is angry, he might throw a tantrum.)

If the bun is successfully removed, we log the status and assess Daniel’s mood. If the operation fails, we immediately trigger **emergency protocols** and evacuate to a safe location.

## Features
- **Bun Detection**: Accurately detects whether Daniel is sporting a bun or not.
- **Anger Detection**: If Daniel is angry, prepare for a **dangerous** confrontation. (Anger management is key).
- **Scissor Technology**: Our **RustyScissors** are the most advanced technology available for cutting buns.
- **Logging & Reporting**: Every move is logged for future analysis, because what’s a bun operation without some data to back it up?

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The backbone of all bun-removal operations. Nothing cuts through code (or buns) like Java.
- **RustyScissors**: Custom-built (not actually rusty) scissors for cutting buns with precision.
- **AngryDanielException**: A custom exception that prevents unnecessary emotional outbursts during the bun removal process.

## Installation
Clone the repository (at your own risk), run the `DebunningService`, and prepare to make Daniel a **bun-free** man.
